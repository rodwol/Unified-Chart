# Language Disparities in NDD Diagnosis – Visualizations

This project presents visual summaries of research findings examining disparities in neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) diagnoses (including ASD and ADHD) by primary language group.

## Charts Included

### 1. Bar Chart: Effect Sizes by Study
- **File:** `ndd_language_disparity_effect_sizes.csv`
- **Visualization:** A vertical bar chart showing adjusted odds ratios (aOR) or prevalence ratios (PR) for NDD diagnoses across studies.
- **Groups:** English, Spanish, and Other language groups.
- **Reference Group:** English
- **Interpretation:**
  - Bars < 1 indicate lower odds of diagnosis relative to English speakers.
  - Bars > 1 indicate higher odds.

### 2. Heatmap: Categorical Study Findings
- **File:** `ndd_diagnosis_heatmap_data.csv`
- **Visualization:** A heatmap summarizing direction and significance of reported findings across studies and diagnostic domains (ASD, ADHD, and general NDD).
- **Symbols:**
  - `↓*`: Lower odds, statistically significant
  - `↓`: Lower odds, not significant
  - `↑`: Higher odds
  - `=`: No association
  - Blank: Not reported or missing

## Purpose
To visually explore how language barriers may influence the likelihood and timing of NDD diagnoses in diverse populations, and to identify where consistent disparities occur across research studies.
